      <h4>I was a student of KWK twice, being a part of my journey to becoming a successful coder.</h4>
      <p>I joined KWK in the summer of 2022 with no knowledge of coding, and KWK provided a welcoming community. My first camp was about web development, and I fell in LOVE with it. After one camp with KWK, I immediately signed up for data science for the next summer. I was able to make two wonderful websites with amazing groups. KWK brought me so much happiness, and I couldn't ask for a better program. ‚ù§</p>
