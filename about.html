        <h4> Hi! I'm Avneek K! </h4>
        <br>
        <p> I am a freshman at St. John's University. My favorite thing to do is dance! I've been dancing since I was 6 years old and it has always been my long-going passion. My new favorite thing to do is coding :)) Creating and designing a new website to share in the program always brings me excitement! I have created two other websites and I got to say, they were so fun to make! GWC brought me happiness in the past 2 weeks and I couldn't ask for a better program <3

        <p> I chose this topic because I truly believe that every women should have basic human rights and abortion is one of them. As a young girl, it is truly scary to see how the Supreme Court are trying to control our body. Although I may not have the ban in my state (New York), my heart goes out to everyone else.
