  <div class="mission-statement">

    <h1>Our mission is to help make education and extracurriculars more equitable for students where they have opportunities, resources, and a voice to spark individuality while achieving success at equal standpoints.</h1> 
    <h2>Those who typically suffer under the problem of inequitable education and disparities are minorities in regards to race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic living, etc. People like us don’t get equal opportunities, resources, or materials that allow us to achieve success at an equal point as other people, such as students in feeder schools. With that being said, many of us are affected by this yet we don’t know what to do or how to combat it. Not only do we miss out on opportunities to help us with school, college, and career, but people like us lose out on individuality in finding our interests and what we want to do in the future. For example, not all opportunities to STEM classes (coding, engineering, etc.) are accessible. That’s why programs like Kode with Klossy are great because they are accessible to marginalized groups seeking opportunities to explore. </h2>
      <h2>With our website, we hope to co-founders spread awareness of this issue, but also emphasize how prevalent and significant it is, as it may affect you as a student, your family, or someone you may know dear to you. We want to be the hub that brings all of those identities together. You have a voice, no matter how little or large the action you may take is. Welcome to Equivue. </h2>

      <h3>Hi there! My name is Jenna and I am one of the cofounders of Equivue. I am a student activist and equity advocate. With that being said, I am exceptionally passionate about creating a safe space for students to have the proper resources, materials, and opportunities in achieving success equally through equity. During the peak of our recent precedent times, many people had strong feelings for the issues occurring regarding discrimination in all kinds of forms. At my school, two of my peers took a step towards change by creating an equity team - a team full of committees that target different issues regarding youth education to create a more equitable and equal education. With this team, I took on two large roles to push forward more change: committee lead of the access to IB/honors for all committee and the curriculum committee, and I am the president of it. With the exceptional work my members and I did, we accomplished a lot over the course of months. That said, I hope the work of Yewande, Avneek, and I make more of an impact outside of my community by showing other marginalized groups that they have a voice and that it should be used. </h3>

      <h3> Hi! I'm Yewande, and as a Nigerian girl who lives in a community with people who mainly look like me, it goes without saying that opportunities for academic enrichment and chances to express my skills as an individual do't come up often. Being a co-founder of this site means a lot to me as I get to help others in similar situations branch out and be given a platform where their intellect is seen as a priority. </h3>

      <h3> Hi! My name is Avneek, and I am one of the co-founders of Equivue. I am a student who is hard of hearing, and I strongly encourage others to never let their disability stop them from pursuing their education. People automatically assume that I won't get into ivy-league colleges because having a disability affects your acceptance rate. Instead of letting that statement bring me down, I always put my best foot forward in school while continuing to improve my coding skills. I am determined to prove everyone wrong by showing them that I can be successful regardless of my disability! I have inspired many students in my school who have a similar experiences, and I want to continue making a change in someone’s life! I am honored to be one of the co-founders of Equivue to continue to help other people use their voices to speak up.</h3>
