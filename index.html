      <h4>Hi! I'm Avneek K!</h4>
      <p>I am a freshman at St. John's University. My favorite thing to do is dance! I've been dancing since I was 6 years old, and it's always been my passion. Lately, I've discovered a new love for coding :) Creating and designing websites is exciting! GWC brought me so much happiness over the past two weeks, and I couldn't ask for a better program. ❤</p>

    <p>I chose this topic because I truly believe that every woman should have access to basic human rights—and abortion is one of them. As a young girl, it’s frightening to see attempts to control our bodies. While abortion remains legal in New York, my heart goes out to everyone in affected states.</p>
