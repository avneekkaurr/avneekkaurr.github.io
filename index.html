      <h4>Protest 1</h4>
      <p>Many women are protesting for their abortion rights. A lot of women are becoming victims of sexual assault, and the ban on abortion in many places causes them distress. The longer the ban, the more potential harm to women. 62% of women in the U.S. disapprove of the Supreme Court's decision. Unsafe abortions kill hundreds of women each year due to lack of access to safe clinics.</p>

      <h5>Protest 2</h5>
      <p>Legalizing abortion would reduce many problems for women and people who can get pregnant. Many face financial struggles or have experienced sexual assault. Some have medical conditions that pose risks to them or the fetus. A 2021 study shows abortion bans could increase pregnancy-related deaths by 21%.</p>
